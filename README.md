# Live-audio-visualization
Quick and dirty live audio visualization I made for a short notice jam session.

Set your device microphone device as Line-In if you're playing something from the computer, or if you have live music that is loud enough (and a good microphone that picks it up well), just leave it as is.

How to use:
Simply run viz.py
(python viz.py in a command line)
You will be prompted to input a number - the number is how many seconds the program listens to in order to determine the BPM of the music.
It will continuously listen and adjust BPM organically as the music progresses.

This is based on beat detection.

The quick and dirty has Carlton dancing to the beat, as well as some other effects of pictures popping in and out, and a background display of the audio signal iteslf in RGB.

Feel free to do whatever you want to it / with it.
